## Task 8 - String Mixer

Given two strings, return the concatenation of the two strings (separated by a space) slicing
out and swapping the first 2 characters of each. 

You can assume that the strings are at least
2 characters long. 

For example:

``mixUp('mix', 'pod')`` =>
``result pox mid``

``mixUp('dog', 'dinner')`` =>
``result dig donner``

``mixUp('gnash', 'sport')`` =>
``result spash gnort``
